In this article, I will show you how to play Battlefield 2 without a CD using the latest patch 1.5 and a no-CD crack for version 1.11. This method will also allow you to play online with other players who have the same patch and crack.
 
## Step 1: Download and Install Patch 1.5
 
Patch 1.5 is the latest official update for Battlefield 2. It fixes many bugs and glitches, adds new maps and weapons, and improves the game performance and stability. You can download the patch from [Mod DB](https://www.moddb.com/games/battlefield-2/downloads/battlefield-2-v15-patch) or other trusted sources.
 
The patch file is about 1.93 GB in size, so it may take some time to download depending on your internet speed. Once you have downloaded the file, run it and follow the instructions to install it. You will need to have the original game installed before applying the patch.
 
## Step 2: Download and Apply No-CD Crack for Version 1.11
 
No-CD crack for version 1.11 is a modified executable file that allows you to run the game without inserting the CD. You can download the crack from [GameBurnWorld](https://www.gameburnworld.com/gp/gamefixes/battlefield2.shtml) or other trusted sources.
 
The crack file is about 1.77 MB in size, so it should be quick to download. Once you have downloaded the file, extract it using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You will see a file named BF2.exe in the extracted folder.
 
Now, go to the folder where you installed Battlefield 2, which is usually C:\Program Files\EA Games\Battlefield 2 by default. Make a backup copy of the original BF2.exe file in case something goes wrong. Then, copy and paste the cracked BF2.exe file into the same folder, replacing the original one.
 
## Step 3: Enjoy Playing Battlefield 2 Without a CD
 
That's it! You have successfully patched and cracked Battlefield 2 to play without a CD. You can now launch the game from your desktop shortcut or start menu and enjoy playing online or offline.
 
Note that this method only works for version 1.11 of the game, which is compatible with patch 1.5. If you have a different version of the game, you will need to find a different crack that matches your version.
 
Also, be aware that using a no-CD crack may violate the terms of service of the game and may result in a ban from online servers or legal action from EA Games. Use this method at your own risk and discretion.
