With FANUC Roboguide, users can import CAD models of existing parts, fixtures and grippers, select and modify robot models and accessories, generate and test robot programs, and evaluate cycle times and performance. FANUC Roboguide also offers dedicated tools for specific applications such as handling, welding, painting and deburring[^5^].
 
FANUC Roboguide is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, requiring very little training. It can reduce the risk of errors and save time and money by enabling visualization and optimization of robotic workcells before actual installation. FANUC Roboguide is compatible with all FANUC robot controllers based on the R-J3iB and R-30iA generations[^4^].
 
If you are interested in FANUC Roboguide, you can download a free trial version from FANUC's website[^6^]. You can also contact FANUC to receive more information on FANUC Roboguide or request a product demonstration[^4^].

One of the advantages of FANUC Roboguide is that it supports a wide range of robot models and accessories. Users can choose from over 150 robot models and over 1000 accessories, including grippers, positioners, conveyors and sensors. Users can also create custom models and accessories using the built-in CAD tools or import them from external sources. FANUC Roboguide allows users to configure and control multiple robots and devices in a single workcell.
 
Another benefit of FANUC Roboguide is that it enables users to program robots using different methods and languages. Users can use the Teach Pendant Interface (TPI) to program robots using the same interface as the real robot controller. Users can also use the Graphical User Interface (GUI) to program robots using drag-and-drop icons and menus. Users can also use the CAD to Path feature to generate robot programs automatically by selecting the area of the part to be processed. FANUC Roboguide supports various programming languages, such as KAREL, TP, RAPID and INFORM.
 
A third advantage of FANUC Roboguide is that it provides users with realistic and accurate simulation results. Users can view the simulation in different modes, such as wireframe, solid or transparent. Users can also adjust the lighting, shading and perspective of the simulation. Users can also use the virtual controller to calculate cycle times and performance data based on the real robot controller parameters. Users can also use the collision detection feature to identify and resolve potential collisions between robots and objects in the workcell.

In addition to the general features of FANUC Roboguide, users can also benefit from the application-specific tools that are available for different robot processes. These tools include HandlingPRO, PaintPRO, PalletPRO, PalletTool and WeldPRO. Each tool has its own features and functions that are tailored to the specific application. For example, HandlingPRO allows users to create material handling applications such as load/unload, packaging, assembly and material removal. PaintPRO allows users to create paint spraying applications by graphically selecting the area of the part to be painted and choosing between several painting methods. PalletPRO and PalletTool allow users to create palletizing applications by selecting and modifying pallet patterns and stations. WeldPRO allows users to create arc welding applications by importing CAD models and generating welding paths automatically.
 
FANUC Roboguide is a powerful robot simulation software that can help users design, program and simulate robotic workcells in 3D. It can reduce the risk of errors and save time and money by enabling visualization and optimization of robotic workcells before actual installation. It can also support a wide range of robot models and accessories, program robots using different methods and languages, and provide realistic and accurate simulation results. Furthermore, it can offer dedicated tools for specific robot applications such as handling, painting, palletizing and welding. FANUC Roboguide is a valuable tool for anyone who wants to improve their robot productivity and performance.
